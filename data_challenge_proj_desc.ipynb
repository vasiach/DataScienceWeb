    "# Project: Predict a userâ€™s next order\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you are given a dataset that describes customers' orders over time in a specific e-shop. The goal of the competition is to predict whether the user will buy products from a specific department in his next order. For each user, we provide between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. We also provide the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.\n",
